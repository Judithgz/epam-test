Like the words of a song, I hear you call
Like a thief in my head, you criminal
You stole my thoughts before I dreamed them
And you killed my queen with just one pawn

This goodbye is no surprise
This goodbye won't make me cry

Yeah, I'll keep on dancin' until I'm dead
Dancin' until I'm dead, I'm dancin' until I'm dead
Yeah, I'll keep on dancin' until I'm dead (dead)
I'll dance until I'm dead (dead, dead, dead, dead)
'Cause when you killed me inside, that's when I came alive
Yeah, the music's gonna bring me back from death
I'm dancin' until I'm dead (dead)
I'll dance until I'm dead (dead, dead, dead, dead)

You've created a creature of the night
Now I'm haunting your air, your soul, your eyes
